# Code Refactor

# Note
Since I transferred from the full-time program, there are a handful of commits in this repository from September. However, I have re-done the homework. In future homeworks, I will create new repositories so they start from a clean slate in terms of commits.

# Description
Presented with a poorly-formatted website that contained numerous errors, I fixed the code in order to satisfy the client's requests to meet greater accessibility standards. This was acheived by creating semantic HTML, creating responsive navbar elements, accesible alt attributes, and fixing CSS formatting issues including commenting.

# Usage
The user should be able to find the page using a search engine, navigate the webpage successfully, and most importantly, be able to use the page with proper accessibilty for those with disabilities.
