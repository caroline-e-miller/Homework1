# Descripton of Project

This assignment was to complete a marketing agency webpage that had HTML errors, as well as CSS formatting issues. The HTML was repaired to allow for functioning links, semantic HTML, sequential header tags, and descriptive alt tags, among other items. The CSS was commented and consolidated to give the reader a clearer and more concise experience with the file.
